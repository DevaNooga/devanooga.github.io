_In an effort to explore the talent in our community, Devanooga is doing a "How I Work" series of articles akin to the series Lifehacker produced in the 2010s. If you would like to be a part of the series, submit a PR with the questions answered or contact one of our moderators._

#### Name
Ryan Maynard

#### Devanooga username
[ryanmaynard](https://www.devanooga.com/members/#ryanmaynard)

#### Occupation
Management Consultant & Owner @ a small software co

#### Location
Chattanooga, TN 37405

#### Current daily computer
IBM Thinkstation running standard Ubuntu

#### Current mobile device
iPhone 12 Pro Max

#### One word that best describes how I work: 
lists

#### What apps, software, and/or tools can't you live without? 
Graphpad, G2 Pilot pens, and a lot of lists.

#### What is your best time-saving shortcut?
Sock day. Every year I buy about 200 of the same brand of anklet sock so that I never have to bother pairing them. I do similar with bulk packs of plain tees for home-office days.

#### What is your workspace setup like?
Autonomous dual-drive sit/stand desk, dual 23" samsung monitors, thinkstation, mac mini, Kanto speakers, Brother printer, Yeti mic, Logitech G512 keyboard, Razer Naga mouse, and a large cup of electrolyte water.

#### Favorite or must-have gear in your workspace?
Really into using Procreate on iPad with an Apple Pencil for diagrams, modeling, sketches, and renders.

#### What do you listen to while you work? 
Lofi or 00s Alt Rock. I make a lot of [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/ryanmaynard?si=19e3a8e5c8e84365).

#### What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What's your secret? 
Taking insurmountable projects and breaking them down into a list of seemingly endless but very doable tasks. I have found that persistence, an open mind, and an iterative process can do things talent couldn't dream of doing. This is exciting to me, because it means I can be mediocre at something, but with enough desire and persistence, can produce above-average output.

#### What is the best advice you have ever received? 
Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.

#### What is some advice you would give to yourself earlier in your career? 
Read and study all you like, but it will never actuate until you start doing.

#### Anything else you would like to add? 
Learning to understand people is how to increase your output at log scale. We all typically want the same things: to be understood, to have a sense of purpose, to belong, to be happy. Being able to read the intent of others, to communicate and listen well, and ultimately - to bring out the best in people, can produce things an individual could never do alone. And besides, everyone has something to teach.
