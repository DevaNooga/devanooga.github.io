_In an effort to explore the talent in our community, Devanooga is doing a "How I Work" series of articles akin to the series Lifehacker produced in the 2010s. If you would like to be a part of the series, submit a PR with the questions answered or contact one of our moderators._

#### Name
Mario Ezra

#### Devanooga username
[me](https://www.devanooga.com/members/#ME)

#### Occupation
Software Developer (.NET/C#)

#### Location
Chattanooga, TN (Ooltewah)

#### Current daily computer
Custom built gaming desktop (for... after work hours). A Lenovo X1 Tablet for travel purposes.

#### Current mobile device
iPhone 12 Mini

#### One word that best describes how I work: 
Very scheduled. I've got specific rituals (like leaving my code broken at the end of the day) and shutting down my computer that I stick to. The first helps me with knowing how to resume and not losing my place. The second keeps work/life separate and gives that sense of "done" for the day.

#### What apps, software, and/or tools can't you live without? 
Rider. (Because Visual Studio is a mess). VS Code (duh). SSMS for all things database.

#### What is your best time-saving shortcut?
See previous answer about leaving stuff broken before leaving your workstation. When you feel blocked, go take a walk.

#### What is your workspace setup like?
Laptop to the side. 1440p monitor to the left. Nothing fancy, just more real estate for code.

#### Favorite or must-have gear in your workspace
WH1000-XM3s (noise cancelling headphones). They make a world of difference. Also have good lighting, really helps the eyes.

#### What do you listen to while you work? 
Youtube Music.... uhhh generally upbeat/happy/techno-esque music. AJR/BTS/Alan Walker/Piano Guys

#### What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What's your secret? 
Finding good articles to read. Don't do work and spend time on reddit/HN (jk). Just be curious, read the articles and then the comments.

#### What is the best advice you have ever received? 
4 Types of People in the world
1. People who will like you for the right reasons
2. People who will like you for the wrong reasons
3. People who will dislike you for the wrong reasons
4. People who will dislike you for the right reasons

#### What is some advice you would give to yourself earlier in your career? 
If it's a bad work environment, never try to negotiate. Just leave.

#### Anything else you would like to add? 
If you've got any questions or want to chat, feel free to DM me. I love hearing/discussing new/random ideas.
