#### Name
Will Lewis

#### Devanooga username
[willamin](https://www.devanooga.com/members/#willamin)

#### Occupation
Software Engineer

#### Location
Chattanooga, TN

#### Current daily computer
Macbook Pro (intel)

#### Current mobile device
iPhone 12 mini

#### What apps, software, and/or tools can't you live without? 
A text editor. I haven't been great about keeping long-term notes, but I need to have a place to quickly jot down notes. I find that the simpler a text editor, the better. Lately Tot is my tool of choice for that.

#### What is your best time-saving shortcut?
Keeping a meticulous log of what I'm doing and when I'm doing it. Even down to the TMI stuff like using the bathroom. By being fully conscious of how long I'm spending scrolling through TikTok, playing games, or finishing chores particularly slowly, I'm able to shift my time around to spend on the things I'd prefer to spend my time on.

#### What is your workspace setup like?
A sit/stand desk with 2 monitors.

#### What do you listen to while you work? 
I rarely listen to music while I work. Almost any music will distract me.
