#### What do you listen to while you work? 
Mostly a classical mix since it's less distracting but sometimes Rush. I prefer not to listen to music I otherwise normally listen to. 

#### What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What's your secret? 
Deciding what work to do and by extension not doing work that I don't think is immediately worth my time. Many tickets get closed because they're already fixed/invalid or the person filing no longer cares. If you **do** have to work to make sure it's something automated, or even better, something that the person asking can do themselves in the future. 

#### What is the best advice you have ever received? 
Vendors are the enemy, treat them as such. Clients are the same, but need to think you're their best friend. 

#### What is some advice you would give to yourself earlier in your career? 
Everyone fakes it till they make it and rock stars are almost always full of it. 

#### Anything else you would like to add? 
Emacs is the one true and good editor.
