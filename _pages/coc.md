## tl;dr
Follow the golden rule: treat others in the way that you would want to be treated.
If you have a conflict with another member, or in any way feel harassed, please contact an admin to discuss the situation.

## General Conduct
All devanooga members are expected to follow these guidelines in our community:

- Avoid language that is unnecessarily offensive to other users
- Come prepared to share ideas _and defend them_. We want a place that is fun and thought provoking.
- You may see ideas that are contrary to yours and that is ok.
- While it is ok to express contrary ideas, it is **NOT** ok to attack, defame, or otherwise harass another member. It **IS** ok (and encouraged) to criticize ideas that you disagree with.
- Bring a positive attitude to all interactions.
- Assume that everyone else is being light-hearted and acting in good faith unless proven otherwise.

## Conflict Resolution
If you or any other member is being treated in a way that violates this CoC, please contact an administrator immediately. You can contact us via slack, the [contact form](/contact/) on this site, or by [email](mailto:admin@devanooga.com).
The administrators will work to resolve the conflict in an open way unless privacy concerns prevent an open dialogue about the problem.

## Conduct of Administrators
devanooga is ran by Chattanooga-area members. We want to foster a community that is driven and shaped by the members. With that in mind:

- Administrators never act alone. Every action taken by an administrator is discussed with the larger group of admins before the action is taken.
- Administrators will do everything within reason to act transparently. In some cases, it may be necessary (for the privacy of members) to do things "behind closed doors". We will avoid this whenever possible.
- Administrators can be removed from power. If they violate the CoC, or otherwise prevent the growth of the community in an intentional way, they can be removed by a majority vote of the other administrators.

## Changes to the Code of Conduct
This is a living document. If you would like to see changes made, please make a Pull Request against our public Github repository with your proposed change.

## Use of the Slack Organization
The use of the devanooga Slack Organization is a privilege we provide and maintain for users that are in good standing with the community. At any time, the admins may choose to revoke the privileges of a user to access the Slack Organization.

We ask that users keep these additional rules in mind when using the devanooga Slack Organization.

- Users are allowed only one account.
- Users may not impersonate other users, celebrities, etc.
- Try to find a relevant channel for a topic of discussion. For example, don't talk about your latest trip to the gun range in `#ruby`.
- Users are welcome to create new channels for any topic. Administrators _may_ remove a channel if it is determined that it violates our CoC.
- Bots are discouraged. If you would like to create a bot, please limit it to only one channel. Keep in mind that most users are wanting to interact with other people, not robots. We may remove bots if they are abused in any way.
