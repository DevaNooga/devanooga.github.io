## tl;dr
Follow the golden rule: treat others in the way that you would want to be treated.
If you have a conflict with another member, or in any way feel harassed, please contact and admin (@bobby_brb3 on slack) to discuss the situation.

## General Conduct
All devanooga members are expected to follow these guidelines in our community:

- Avoid language that is unnecessarily offensive to other users
- Come prepared to share ideas _and defend them_. We want a place that is fun and thought provoking.
- devanooga is not a safe space. You may see ideas that are contrary to yours and that is ok.
- While it is ok to express contrary ideas, it is **NOT** ok to attack, defame, or otherwise harass another member. It **IS** ok (and encouraged) to criticize ideas that you disagree with.
